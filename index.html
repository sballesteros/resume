      <h2>About me</h2>

      <p>
        I was trained as an engineer and agronomist but faced the delusion of so
        called agricultural development. I escaped and sought refuge in an ivory
        tower working in the theoretical world of statistics, mathematical
        modeling, epidemiology and theoretical ecology & evolution. There, I saw
        some infrastructural flaws and founded a company to change the way
        science is being published and used. Along the way, I became a versatile
        technologist with a solid experience in web development and turning
        ideas into products.

      <section>
        <h3>CTO / CEO sci.pe, New York City - Los Angeles</h3>
        <p>since 2014</p>
        <p>
          Designed the vision, built the product and managed the team behind
          sci.pe. sci.pe re-invented the scholarly publishing platform and was
          the first company to help publishers to transition to web first
          publishing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The company was incubated by Mozilla webFWD and Techstars NYC and
          worked with major publishers as clients.

        <h3>Postdoctoral fellow, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ</h3>
        <p>2011 - 2014</p>
        <p>
          I developed the infrastucture necessary to build a public library of
          models of the dynamic processes of infectious disease spread and
          control usable on demand from a web browser.

        <h3>Postdoctoral fellow for EPIWORK project, CMAF Centro de Matemática e Aplicações Fundamentais, Lisboa.</h3>
        <p>2010 - 2011</p>
        <p>
          The EPIWORK project proposes a multidisciplinary research effort aimed
          at developing the appropriate framework of tools and knowledge needed
          for the design of epidemic forecast infrastructures to be used by
          epidemiologists and public health scientists. Within the project, I
          participated in the foundation and development of web interfaces to
          collect and access epidemiological data as well as in the development
          of statistical and computational methods needed to achieve inference,
          prediction, and predictability of disease spreading in complex
          techno-social systems.

        <h3>Ph.D. thesis in Ecology and Evolution, Laboratory Ecology and
        Evolution (UMR 7625); Universite Pierre et Marie Curie, Ecole Normale
        Supérieure, Paris, Awarded with distinction and special mention from the
        examination board.</h3>
        <p>2006 - 2009</p>

        <p>
          My thesis focused on the melding of immunodynamics, epidemiology and
          evolutionary biology. I used a combination of mathematical and
          statistical approaches to understand the processes driving outbreak
          dynamics and the wide range of pathogen phylogenies observed at scales
          from individual host to populations. Developements focused on
          influenza, dengue, and HIV.
